## External Resources
- [Stack OverFlow](http://stackoverflow.com/) has been very helpful in resolving any general python questions and problems we had over the course of this project.

- The documentation on [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) allowed us to to incorporate the gaming aspect of our program.

- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ&vl=en) and the supporting [code](https://github.com/stmorgan/pythonNNexample) introduced us to neural nets

- But this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs) helped us actually understand neural nets

- This [example](https://excel.ucf.edu/classes/2007/Spring/appsII/Chapter1.pdf) was helpful in understanding classification using neural nets and showing us that they weren't the best solution to our problem
