Though the details will be different for each project, show off what your software can do! Screenshots and video are likely helpful. Include graphs or other data if appropriate.

### Evolutionary Algorithm
Currently the algorithm can run through a population of 20 AIs for 20 generations to evolve the most fit AIs. Below is an image of an example run of the algorithm. The average difference in minimum and maximum fitness values increases for each generation because having a high fitness value is advantageous.

Once the algorithm is done running, it stores the remaining AIs. Below are the fitness values associated with each AI.
