## Architecture Review Reflection

# Based upon your notes from the technical review, synthesize the feedback you received addressing your key questions. How do you plan to incorporate it going forward? What new questions did you generate?
  Using the Force AI seems to be the best way to move forward. People seemed enthused by the Force AI so we are going to use that model and start researching about how to implement it.
  There was mixed responses about which style of game we should do (2 AIs vs. Player and AI interaction). Feedback included that if it were a 2 AI situation, user input would be interesting to include (ie: add walls in the middle of the game). However, if the AIs had distinct and successful personalities, playing against the AI as a user would also be interesting. Because we will have to build 2 AIs running against each other anyway, we will reevaluate the final user interactions once we start working on stretch goals.
