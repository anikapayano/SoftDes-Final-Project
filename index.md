# Gods of Capture
### The Class
Gods of Capture is a final class project for a semester-long course at Olin
College of Engineering titled "Software Design". The course gives an
introduction to designing, writing, debugging, and optimizing code, as well as
a number of toolboxes designed to allow students to tailor their experience and
assignments to fit what skills they want to get out of the course.
### The Project
Gods of Capture is a 5-person project created in 4 weeks, loosely based upon the
[Evolutionary Algorithms toolbox](https://sd17spring.github.io//toolboxes/evolutionary-algorithms/)
and the [AI and Algorithms toolbox](https://sd17spring.github.io//toolboxes/algorithms-and-ai/)
 found on the [SoftDes website](https://sd17spring.github.io//). We chose this
 project because we wanted to learn more about Artificial Intelligence, and we
 thought that if we built the mechanics behind the game, we'd fully understand
 how the AI would interact with the game. We then decided that we wanted to
 build AIs based on play styles, and decided to see if we could evolve AIs to
 use certain strategies using an evolutionary algorithm that mimics the natural
 process of evolution.
### The Result
Gods of Capture's final representation is a capture the flag game with simple
blob sprites attempting to capture the opponent's flag and return it to their
base. Both sides are controlled by a separate AI, and one AI is played off
against the other, then evolved based on it's performance.
